## Begin (raw)
<!-- 3-minute brain dump. Do not edit or reinterpret. -->

This is my portfolio website project in which I want to use Three.js or GSAP to make the UI more interactive and 3D and create a simple one page portfolio website that showcases my projects and my skills.

## Refine (scope)

- **Goal**: Build a single-page interactive portfolio website showcasing projects and skills with 3D/animated UI effects
- **In scope**:
  - Vue 3 + TypeScript setup with Vite
  - Three.js for 3D scenes (interactive particles / space theme)
  - GSAP for scroll animations and transitions
  - Hero section with space-themed 3D particle animation
  - Projects showcase section (2 projects)
  - Skills/expertise section
  - Contact section
  - Design exploration phase (no mockup provided)
  - Responsive design for all browsers
- **Out of scope**: Blog, CMS, backend API, authentication
- **Definition of Done**:
  - Site deploys successfully to Netlify
  - All sections render correctly across modern browsers
  - 3D/animation effects work smoothly
  - Site is responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Constraints**:
  - Must use TypeScript throughout
  - Cross-browser compatibility required
  - Hosted on Netlify
- **Risks**: TBD
- **Resources**: TBD
- **Dependencies**: None (greenfield project)
